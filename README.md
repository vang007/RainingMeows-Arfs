# RainingMeows-Arfs
Weather to whether or Whether the storm?
Whether weather is spelled wrong or not, it'll be ruled by cats and dogs for the next few days. No, not the furry or fuzzy, four-legged friends! RAIN!!, PUDDLES!! SPLASH!!, WET!! SUN (away on vacation for the next couple of days)?!?! 

This is RainingMeows-Arfs Weather App! Choose your city...the city of a planned destination...the city of other family members...or, if you just want to feel sad,a city where you know it'll almost always have the giant, Mister Golden Sun, shine-ning down on them!
